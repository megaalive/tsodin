# M4-A — first primitive checker slice

The development-only `src/checker` package completes the first **narrow
source → scanner → syntax → binder → primitive type diagnostics** pipeline.
It is not yet the full `tsodin check` command or TypeScript 7 parity.

## Supported, explicit subset

- One source file, with complete M2 syntax and complete M3-A binding
  from the *same immutable File_Id + generation*.
- `const`, `let`, `var`; optional primitive annotations (`number`,
  `string`, `boolean`); numeric and plain ASCII string literals.
- Nonforward, initialized local name references, unary numeric `+`/`-`,
  numeric `+`/`-`/`*`/`/`, and basic numeric/string concatenation.
- Simple primitive assignability and inferred base `number`/`string`
  types. This deliberately does not preserve TypeScript literal types.

## Memory and correctness boundary

The checker evaluates postorder parser nodes iteratively, using three
temporary dense arrays: inferred expression types, declaration types, and
symbol-reference indices. There is **no per-expression heap allocation** or
checker recursion, but no speedup is claimed before a measured real project.

A source with unsupported forward-use/temporal-dead-zone rules, uncertain
definite assignment, implicit-any declarations, unsupported operators,
unresolved names, stale snapshots, or invalid syntax is **rejected**.
Type mismatches emit internal `Assignment_Type_Mismatch` issues with
byte-span positions, which can be projected to UTF-16 by the source mapper.
Internal issues are NOT TypeScript diagnostic codes; do not label them TS2322.

`Report.complete` becomes true only after every declaration in the declared
subset was analyzed with no issues; mismatch reports are non-success.
`report_destroy` frees report-owned diagnostics.

## Proof

- `odin test src/checker`: type inference, arithmetic precedence,
  string concatenation, multiple mismatches, forward-use refusal,
  uninitialized references, incomplete binding and stale snapshots.
- `src/checktrace`: developer-only Odin executable reading actual .ts
  files and emitting source-to-type-diagnostics with UTF-16 positions;
  exit 0 accepted, 1 type mismatch, 2 fatal/unsupported.
- `tools/oracle/check-primitive-trace.mjs`: CI integration smoke of that
  executable on two project source files.
- Separate pinned TS7 CLI oracle captures for valid and error projects.
  They do **not** yet compare tsodin diagnostic code, span or message to
  TypeScript. The official conformance Pages panel must remain NOT RUN.

## Next gates

M4-B must turn captured TS7 diagnostics into strict differential assertions
with explicit unsupported cases. Expand lexical/grammar handling and type
relations only after keeping the complete supported slice correct.
Real-project benchmarking is premature while C1 parity remains open.

## M4-E — boolean literal vertical slice

Both `true` and `false` now have appended stable scanner token kinds,
a dedicated source-spanned boolean expression node and `Primitive.Boolean`
in the non-recursive checker. Previous scanner token ordinals remain intact.
Boolean literal inference and assignment to `boolean` declarations are
supported within the exact existing single-file grammar.

Operations such as `true + 1` are **not** accepted. Full TypeScript boolean
flow analysis, literal narrowing, truthiness, logical operators and
control-flow semantics are not implemented. Unsupported work remains fatal.

Two independent TypeScript 7.0.2 CLI projects test a valid boolean program
and two `TS2322` primitive mismatches. The Odin trace is checked against
the same fixtures for type errors. This is a bounded semantic extension,
not full conformance.
